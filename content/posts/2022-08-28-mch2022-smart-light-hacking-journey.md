title: MCH2022 - A Smart Light Hacking Journey
---

Last July, [Tom](https://twitter.com/Tom_Clement) and I gave a talk about the recent work we've done [jailbreaking smart devices]({{< relref "2022-03-29-light-jailbreaking-exploiting-tuya-iot-devices" >}}) at [MCH2022](https://mch2022.org). In that talk, we've told the story of how we went down this rabbit hole, explaining a few (potential) bugs we hadn't shared before as well as the details of the vulnerability we ended up utilizing on smart devices based on the BK7231 platform.

Here are the [slides for the talk](/assets/blog/img/cf4b4c8c37f884844caeac63a68ea2aa6ac01485bc00b7337870e1ec56cb44f2.pdf), modified to cover some talking points textually. Additionally, there is a recording of the talk that is available at [media.ccc.tv](https://media.ccc.de/v/mch2022-191-a-smart-light-hacking-journey) (embed below).

I would like to thank everyone who supported us throughout our brief journey as well as all the lovely people with whom we've had great discussions after the talk! See you all next time!
