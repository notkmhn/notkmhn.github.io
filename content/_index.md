# Hi, I'm Khaled
Online, I go by some variation of my initials and/or name: [**kmhn**](https://keybase.io/kmhn) for the most part, but sometimes [**kmhnassar**](https://twitter.com/kmhnassar).

I have a background in computer science and cybersecurity with a wide interest in a number of their subfields. Usually, I'm up to discuss programming, software architecture, embedded systems, cryptography and everything else in between!

You can check out some of my posts about these topics [here](/posts) or on [rootfs.eu](https://rootfs.eu).
