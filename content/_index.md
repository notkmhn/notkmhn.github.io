# Hi, I'm Khaled
Online, I go by some variation of my initials: [**notkmhn**](https://twitter.com/notkmhn) and [**kmhn**](https://keybase.io/kmhn) whenever I can claim a short handle.

I have a background in computer science and cybersecurity with a wide interest in a number of their subfields. Usually, I'm up to discuss programming, software architecture, embedded systems, cryptography and everything else in between!

In my free time, I take up random research and/or fun projects in these topics and participate in hacking Capture The Flag (CTF) tournaments with [Spotless](https://spotless.tech). You can check out some of my posts about these projects (and whatever else, really) [here](/posts) or on [rootfs.eu](https://rootfs.eu).
